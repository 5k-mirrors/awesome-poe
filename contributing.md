# Contribution Guidelines

## What

- Awesome PoE-related things.
- Use the following format: `[Name](link) - Description.`
- Watch for casing and spelling.
- Describe what the tool is doing. No marketing slogans. E.g. instead of "Do XYZ", use "[Kind of tool] to do XYZ". Avoid marketing words such as: easy, simple, beautiful, premium, powerful, amazing.
- Avoid subjective words like "smaller", "bigger".
- Avoid starting with "A" or "An".
- Avoid using "your" (e.g. "for your profile" => "for profiles", "back to your profile" => "back to the profile").
- Avoid numbers, they will get outdated.
